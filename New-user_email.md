Congratulations! You have been selected to test HipChat.

Please use the link below to login.

HipChat is email authenticated meaning you will login with your email address and password. That being said, when you change your Windows/Email password, HipChat will change. 

After you login, you will be greeted with a Welcome page. From there, you can download the desktop client. If you decide to use the desktop client, it is configured to point to HipChat’s hosted servers. In order to point it to ours, you will need to select “Configure Connection”:
 

From there, you will change the selection under “Connect to” to “HipChat Server”. The address you need to enter is “indy-hipchat.milliman.com” 
 
Select OK and then continue to login as normal. You only need to do this once. 

For the time being, you will receive a prompt concerning an invalid certificate. This is simply because the server is currently using a self-signed cert. Select “I know what I’m doing.”
 and continue the login process. 
 


Let me know if you have any issues and I will be glad to assist!
