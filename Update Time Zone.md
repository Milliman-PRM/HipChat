I know this is a pain but currently the default time zone is set to UTC 0. The server time zone is not something you can change(has to do with HipChat internal programming etc...) and thus, is profile independent. To change it, login in to the web portal(indy-hipchat.milliman.com), find your person icon on the top right to the right of the question mark, select "Account Settings" and find "Timezone" under "Your info". I believe to make a change you have to enter in a "Job Title" though.
